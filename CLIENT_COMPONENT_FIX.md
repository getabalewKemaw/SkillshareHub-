# ✅ Client Component Fix - Build Error Resolved

## 🐛 Problem

**Error:**
```
Export useForm doesn't exist in target module
./app/components/courses/CourseForm.tsx (4:1)
```

**Cause:**
- `CourseForm.tsx` was missing `"use client"` directive
- `react-hook-form` only works in Client Components
- Component was being imported in Server Component

---

## ✅ Solution

Added `"use client"` to components that use React hooks:

### Fixed Components:
1. ✅ `app/components/courses/CourseForm.tsx`
2. ✅ `app/components/courses/EnrollmentButton.tsx`

---

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### CourseForm.tsx
```typescript
// Before (BROKEN)
// For creating/editing courses...
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";

// After (FIXED)
"use client"

// For creating/editing courses...
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";
```

### EnrollmentButton.tsx
```typescript
// Before (BROKEN)
// Handles enrollment...
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

// After (FIXED)
"use client"

// Handles enrollment...
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
```

## 📋 Rule: When to Use "use client"

**Add `"use client"` if your component uses:**
- ✅ React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useForm`, etc.)
- ✅ Event handlers (`onClick`, `onChange`, etc.)
- ✅ Browser APIs (`window`, `localStorage`, etc.)
- ✅ Third-party libraries that use hooks (react-hook-form, etc.)

**DON'T add `"use client"` if:**
- ❌ Component only renders static content
- ❌ Component only uses Server Components features
- ❌ Component fetches data on server

---

## ✅ Already Fixed Components

These components already have `"use client"`:
- ✅ `LoginForm.tsx`
- ✅ `SignupForm.tsx`
- ✅ `NavBar.tsx`

---

## 🧪 Test the Fix

### Test Course Creation
```
1. Start server: npm run dev
2. Login as instructor: john@instructor.com / password123
3. Go to: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/instructor/create
4. ✅ Form should load without errors
5. Fill course details
6. Submit
7. ✅ Course created!
```
