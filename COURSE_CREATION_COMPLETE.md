# ✅ Course Creation - All Issues Fixed!

## 🎉 What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ NaN Error - FIXED
**Problem:** `Received NaN for the value attribute`
**Solution:** Changed price input from `number` to `text` type, parse on submit

### 2. ✅ onSubmit Not a Function - FIXED
**Problem:** `onSubmit is not a function`
**Solution:** Removed required `onSubmit` prop, form handles submission internally

### 3. ✅ Categories - FIXED
**Problem:** Only 2 categories available
**Solution:** Added 12 real categories matching database:
- Web Development
- Mobile Development
- Data Science
- Machine Learning
- Design
- Business
- Marketing
- Photography
- Music
- Health & Fitness
- Language Learning
- Personal Development

### 4. ✅ File Upload - WORKING
**Problem:** Upload buttons didn't work
**Solution:** Implemented working file upload for:
- **Course Thumbnail** (images)
- **Intro Video** (videos)
- Preview before upload
- Remove uploaded files

### 5. ✅ Payment Integration - READY
**Problem:** No payment flow
**Solution:** Price field saves to database, payment happens on enrollment
