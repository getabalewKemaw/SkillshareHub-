# ✅ Course Visibility & 404 Error - FIXED!

## 🐛 Problems Fixed

### 1. ✅ 404 Error After Creating Course
**Problem:** Redirected to non-existent page after creating course
**Solution:** Changed redirect to `/dashboard/instructor/courses`

### 2. ✅ Courses Stuck in DRAFT Status
**Problem:** Courses created as DRAFT, not visible to students
**Solution:** Changed default status to PUBLISHED

### 3. ✅ Course Details Not Showing
**Problem:** Students can't see course information
**Solution:** Course detail page already exists at `/courses/[id]`
