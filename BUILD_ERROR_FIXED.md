# ✅ Build Error Fixed - Course Creation Working

## 🐛 Original Error

```
Export useForm doesn't exist in target module
./app/components/courses/CourseForm.tsx (4:1)

The export useForm was not found in module
[project]/node_modules/react-hook-form/dist/react-server.esm.mjs
```

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

Added `"use client"` directive to components using React hooks.

### Fixed Files:
1. ✅ `app/components/courses/CourseForm.tsx`
2. ✅ `app/components/courses/EnrollmentButton.tsx`
3. ✅ `app/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` (cleaned up)

## 📋 What "use client" Does

**In Next.js 13+ App Router:**
- Components are Server Components by default
- Server Components can't use React hooks or browser APIs
- Adding `"use client"` makes it a Client Component
- Client Components can use hooks, event handlers, etc.

**When to add `"use client"`:**
```typescript
// ✅ Need "use client" for:
- useState, useEffect, useForm, etc.
- onClick, onChange, onSubmit, etc.
- window, localStorage, document, etc.
- Third-party libraries with hooks

// ❌ Don't need "use client" for:
- Static rendering
- Server-side data fetching
- Components without interactivity
```

---

## ✅ All Components Status

### Client Components (with "use client")
- ✅ `LoginForm.tsx`
- ✅ `SignupForm.tsx`
- ✅ `NavBar.tsx`
- ✅ `CourseForm.tsx` ← **FIXED**
- ✅ `EnrollmentButton.tsx` ← **FIXED**

### Server Components (no "use client")
- ✅ `CourseCard.tsx` (static display)
- ✅ `ReviewList.tsx` (static display)
- ✅ Page components (unless they use hooks)

---

## 🎯 Quick Reference

### Adding "use client"
```typescript
"use client"  // ← Must be first line!

import { useState } from "react";
// ... rest of your component
```

### Common Patterns

**Form Component:**
```typescript
"use client"
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";

export function MyForm() {
  const form = useForm();
  // ...
}
```

**Interactive Component:**
```typescript
"use client"
import { useState } from "react";

export function MyButton() {
  const [clicked, setClicked] = useState(false);
  return <button onClick={() => setClicked(true)}>Click</button>;
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Still getting build errors?
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

### TypeScript errors?
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### Module not found?
```bash
npm install
```
