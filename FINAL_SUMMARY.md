## 🚀 How to Get Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
# Copy env.example to .env
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env with your values:
# - DATABASE_URL (PostgreSQL connection)
# - NEXTAUTH_SECRET (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)
# - CHAPA_SECRET_KEY (from Chapa dashboard)
```

### 3. Set Up Database
```bash
# Generate Prisma Client (resolves TypeScript errors)
npx prisma generate

# Run migrations (creates tables)
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# Seed database (creates test data)
npx prisma db seed
```

### 4. Create Upload Directories
```bash
mkdir -p public/uploads/avatar
mkdir -p public/uploads/video
mkdir -p public/uploads/course-thumbnail
mkdir -p public/uploads/lesson-video
mkdir -p public/uploads/document
```

### 5. Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 6. Test the Application
Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

**Test Accounts:**
- Student: `alice@student.com` / `password123`
- Instructor: `john@instructor.com` / `password123`
- Admin: `admin@skillshare.com` / `password123`

## 🧪 Testing Workflows

### Test Flow 1: New Student
1. Sign up → Select "Student" → Complete onboarding
2. View personalized recommendations on dashboard
3. Browse courses → Add to cart → Checkout
4. Complete payment (test mode) → Verify enrollment

### Test Flow 2: New Instructor
1. Sign up → Select "Instructor" → Complete onboarding
2. Create course → Add lessons → Publish
3. View course in public listing
4. Check student enrollments and revenue

### Test Flow 3: Matching Algorithm
1. Login as student with "JavaScript" interests
2. Verify recommended courses match interests
3. Check match percentage badges
4. Verify recommended instructors have JavaScript skills

---

## 📊 Seed Data Included

The database seed creates:
- **1 Admin** account
- **3 Instructors** (Web Dev, Data Science, Design)
- **3 Students** (different interests)
- **6 Courses** (mix of free and paid)
- **Lessons** for courses
- **Enrollments** with progress tracking
- **Reviews** and ratings
- **Cart items**
- **Payment records**

All accounts use password: `password123`

---

## 🎯 Matching Algorithm Details

### How It Works
1. **Extract user interests/skills** from onboarding data
2. **Calculate Jaccard similarity** between tags
3. **Apply weighted scoring**:
   - Course tags: 60%
   - Instructor skills: 30%
   - Popularity: 10%
4. **Sort by match score**
5. **Display top recommendations** with badges

### Example
Student interests: `["JavaScript", "React"]`
Course tags: `["JavaScript", "React", "Node.js"]`

```
Intersection: ["JavaScript", "React"] = 2
Union: ["JavaScript", "React", "Node.js"] = 3
Similarity: 2/3 = 67% match ✓
```

## 💳 Chapa Payment Integration

### Test Mode Setup
1. Get test key from [Chapa Dashboard](https://dashboard.chapa.co/)
2. Add to `.env`: `CHAPA_SECRET_KEY="CHASECK_TEST-..."`
3. Use test card: `4200 0000 0000 0000`

### Payment Flow
1. Student adds courses to cart
2. Clicks "Proceed to Checkout"
3. API creates payment record
4. Redirects to Chapa checkout
5. Student completes payment
6. Chapa sends webhook
7. API verifies payment
8. Creates enrollments
9. Clears cart
10. Redirects to success page

6. Set up production file storage (S3/Vercel Blob)

### Short Term
1. Email notifications (enrollment, payment)
2. Course reviews UI
3. Certificate generation (PDF)
4. Progress tracking UI (lesson checkboxes)
5. Full-text search

### Long Term
1. Instructor analytics dashboard
2. Live chat (instructor-student)
3. Quiz system with scoring
4. Assignment submission
5. Mobile app (React Native)

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### TypeScript Errors (Expected)
- Run `npx prisma generate` to resolve
- Restart TypeScript server in VS Code

### File Uploads
- Local development only (use S3 for production)
- No file size limits enforced (add in production)

### Payment Testing
- Requires Chapa test account
- Webhook testing needs ngrok for local dev
