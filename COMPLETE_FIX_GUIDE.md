## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: TypeScript Errors
**Solution:**
```bash
npx prisma generate
# Restart VS Code TypeScript server: Ctrl+Shift+P → "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
```

### Issue: Can't Login
**Symptoms:** "Invalid email or password"
**Solutions:**
1. Check database is running
2. Run `npx prisma db seed` to create test accounts
3. Check `.env` has correct `DATABASE_URL`
4. Check password is exactly `password123`

### Issue: URL Construction Error
**Symptoms:** Console error about invalid URL
**Solution:** Already fixed in `lib/auth.ts` - make sure you pulled latest code

### Issue: Signup Not Working
**Symptoms:** Form submits but nothing happens
**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check `/api/auth/signup` endpoint exists
3. Check database connection
4. Try with different email

### Issue: Google Login Not Saving
**Symptoms:** Can login with Google but user not in database
**Solutions:**
1. Check `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`
2. Check `signIn` callback in `lib/auth.ts`
3. Check database connection
4. Look for errors in server console

### Issue: Redirected to Onboarding Every Time
**Symptoms:** Complete onboarding but still redirected
**Solutions:**
1. Check `onboardingCompleted` field in database
2. Make sure onboarding form submits successfully
3. Check middleware logic
4. Try logging out and back in

### Issue: Can't Access Instructor Dashboard
**Symptoms:** Redirected away from `/dashboard/instructor`
**Solutions:**
1. Make sure you're logged in as instructor
2. Check user role in database: `SELECT role FROM "User" WHERE email='your@email.com';`
3. Complete instructor onboarding
4. Check middleware role checks
